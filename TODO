This file contains the list of known items not finished in the source code.
They should be added to the bug tracker.
  -- Docs
    -- Design spec
    -- Doxygen
  -- Makefiles
    -- need automated regression tests (make test)
    -- automake and autoconf need to replace platform/*
    -- support for Windows needed
    -- MAC fink packaging not done
  -- yangdump
   -- comments are not translated at all; they are always discarded
   -- ncx:cli YANG convert to unix man files
   -- ietf validation mode not supported
   -- YANG to xml2rfc not supported
   -- XSD translation:  
     --'minOccurs not allowed' bug reported by 
       Martin Bjorklund, 2008-11-20.
     -- anyxml not supported
   -- HTML generation:
      -- when-stmt may not be fully supported
      -- refine-stmt not supported
      -- deviation-stmt not supported
      -- JQuery menu not supported
   -- SIL code generation not done:
     -- RPC output
     -- list key retrieval
     -- support for NCX_ERR_SKIPPED to PASS callback to parent
        partially handled (or skipped)
     -- choice code generation is broken; a Q header
        is not passed by the stack.  Only individual case member
        callbacks would be invoked instead.
     -- list and leaf-list code generation is also wrong because
        a Q header would not be passed by the stack.  Instead,
        a NCX_BT_LIST or normal base type for a leaf-list would
        be passed. 
     -- conditional code generation for features and the CLI
        parms for this functionality is not done
     -- when-stmt auto-gen code is not done
  -- yangcli to-do:
     -- fill /a gets the first namespace that matches
        because none is specified; should print warning
        like for the command name
     -- replace libtecla with readline
     -- command completion for more data types
     -- command completion based on mirror of database
  -- server bugs:
    -- deleted node markers not supported so sibling order
       can be lost during a rollback for a move operation
    -- rollback-on-error not fully tested; only applies
       to commit phase because only allowed on <running> config.
    -- ietf-netconf.yang not used internally.  hacks are used
       to advertise ietf-netconf but use yuma-netconf.
       An 'annotation' feature like deviation-stmt is needed
       to split out the implementation extensions and other
       YANG statements from the standard module.
    -- features are not advertised for ietf-netconf, 
       just capabilities
    -- openssh client hello bug: the client hello code is not
       used; not sure why the SSH application timeout occurs even
       if there is NETCONF traffic; must be doing something
       wrong in the client or server SSH code.
   -- server optimizations not done:
      -- NACM cache per-msg, not more persistent
      -- virtual node caching
      -- mechanisms to bypass must-stmt and when-stmt evaluation
         during validation
      -- save to NVstore:
        -- user hook to override output to XML file
        -- write /config/foo in sub-directories instead of
           XML. Start the XML file(s) for the next layer.
           /config/foo/bar.xml
