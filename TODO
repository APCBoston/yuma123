yuma123 to-do List (2017-01-31)

This file contains the list of known items not finished in the source code.
  -- ietf-yang-library.yang implementation
  -- YANG 1.1 support (RFC 7950)
   -- new Xpath functions - re-match, deref, enum-value, bit-is-set
   -- if-feature in identities, enum, bit
   -- action statement
   -- anydata statement
   -- modifier statement
   -- ... to be continued
  -- yangcli to-do:
     -- command completion for more data types
     -- command completion based on mirror of database
  -- server bugs:
    -- ietf-netconf.yang not used internally.  hacks are used
       to advertise ietf-netconf but use yuma-netconf.
       An 'annotation' feature like deviation-stmt is needed
       to split out the implementation extensions and other
       YANG statements from the standard module.
    -- features are not advertised for ietf-netconf, 
       just capabilities
    -- openssh client hello bug: the client hello code is not
       used; not sure why the SSH application timeout occurs even
       if there is NETCONF traffic; must be doing something
       wrong in the client or server SSH code.
    -- load module chicken-and-egg bug:
      - load a module dynamically and then save some config in
        in the newly loaded module namespace.  Since there is no
        'load foo' added to the netconfd CLI or .conf file,
        this new config will be treated as unknown namespace error
        on the next reboot
    -- SIL user callback functions do not yet support a 'PASS' mode,
       so that multiple callback handlers within the same YANG
       data structure can be utilized.  
  -- server optimizations not done:
    -- save to NVstore:
      -- user hook to override output to XML file
      -- write /config/foo in sub-directories instead of
         XML. Start the XML file(s) for the next layer.
         /config/foo/bar.xml
