This testcase validates that when modules of differing versions
are reported yangcli downloads and uses the ones implemented on
the server side. The testcase has server-modules and client-modules
directories with different incompatible definitions. The testcase
validates that the client side modules are not loaded and the
server side modules are in fact the ones in use.
