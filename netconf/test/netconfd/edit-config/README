     correctly committed.
 * session.duplicated-list-entry.litenc.py - python script using litenc python module (added at ../litenc).
     Connects to the started netconf server performs edit-config RPCs and verify edit-config attempting to

OPERATION:
 Uses edit-config and reads back the configuration with get-config for verification.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
 One can start confd server instead of netconfd by exporting variable named RUN_WITH_CONFD
 Example:
  export RUN_WITH_CONFD=~/confd/root ; ./run.sh

 The ~/confd/root in the example is the path to the confd installation where confdrc is located.
