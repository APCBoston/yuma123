= Introduction =
[[Image:yuma-tools.png]]

Refer to section 3 of the Yuma User Manual for a complete introduction
to Yuma.

This section focuses on the client and server tools within the Yuma
programs.

== Intended Audience ==
This document is intended for users of the Yuma NETCONF client and
server programs. It covers the installation of the Yuma packages.

= Installation Requirements =
The following requirements must be met for Yuma to be installed.

== Supported Platforms ==
There are no binary packages distributed at this time. Binaries can be
compiled from source and installed using Autotools/Automake or built as
Debian package from source using the Debian package management tools.
The build scripts are tested on the following platforms:

* Debian 8.0 "jessie" (32 bit x86 and 64-bit AMD)
* Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS (Precise Pangolin) (32 bit x86 and 64-bit AMD)

== External Packages ==
The following programs and libraries need to be available for Yuma to
work.

=== libxml2 ===
The '''libxml2''' package is needed by the yuma package for some of the
XML parsing functions. This package is installed by the default Linux
installation process.

To build yuma sources, also install the developer version of this
package. It is called '''libxml2-dev '''on Debian systems.

=== libssh2 ===
The '''libssh2''' package is needed by the yuma package for the
'''yangcli''' program to connect to NETCONF servers using the SSH
protocol. This package is called '''libssh2-1''' on Ubuntu platforms.
This package is '''not''' installed by the default Linux installation
process.

To build yuma sources, also install the developer version of this
package. It is called '''libssh2-1-dev '''on Debian systems.

=== ncurses ===
The '''ncurses''' library is needed by the yuma package for some
terminal support. This package is installed by the default Linux
installation process.

It is called '''libncurses5''' on Ubuntu systems. 

To build yuma sources, also install the developer version of this
package. It is called '''libncurses5-dev '''on Debian systems.

=== zlib ===
The '''zlib''' library is needed by the yuma package for some
compression support, used by other libraries that yuma imports. This
package is installed by the default Linux installation process.

To build yuma sources, also install the developer version of this
package. It is called '''libz-dev '''on Debian systems.

=== libreadline ===
The '''libreadline''' library is needed by the yuma package for command
line handling. This package is installed by the default Linux
installation process.

To build yuma sources, also install the developer version of this
package. It is called '''libreadline-dev '''on Debian systems.

= Getting the source =
 ~> git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/yuma123/git yuma123
 ~> cd yuma123

= Building and Installation =
You can either use the Debian/Ubuntu package management tools or
directly the Autotools build scripts if the platform you have is not
Debian based or you need more flexibility.
== Alternative 1:  Debian/Ubuntu *.deb package build and installation
steps ==
Check if you have any unmet dependencies:
 yuma123> dpkg-checkbuilddeps
 dpkg-checkbuilddeps: Unmet build dependencies: libssh2-1-dev
libxml2-dev 
Install the missing packages:
 yuma123> sudo apt-get install libssh2-1-dev libxml2-dev
Build the *.deb:
 yuma123> dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b
The generated *.deb package e.g. ../yuma123_2.5-1_i386.deb can be
installed:
 yuma123> sudo dpkg -i ../yuma123_2.5-1_i386.deb

== Alternative 2: Autotools build and installation steps==
Assuming you have no unresolved dependencies:
 yuma123> autoreconf -i -f
 yuma123> ./configure CFLAGS='-g -O0' CXXFLAGS='-g -O0' --prefix=/usr
 yuma123> make
 yuma123> sudo make install

= Installed Files =
* '''/usr/bin''' directory contains the following programs:
**yangcli
**yangrpc-example
* '''/usr/sbin''' directory contains the following server programs:
** netconfd
** netconf-subsystem
* '''/usr/lib '''directory contains the following files:
** libyumancx.so
** libyumaagt.so
** libyumamgr.so
** libyangrpc.so
* '''/usr/lib/yuma''' directory contains the following file:
** libhelloworld.so
** libtoaster.so
* '''/usr/share/yuma/modules''' directory contains all the YANG modules:
**yang/
**ietf/
**netconfcentral/
**ietf-draft/
**helloworld.yang
* '''/usr/share/doc/yuma123''' directory (*.deb only) containing the
following files:
** copyright
** changelog.Debian.gz
* '''/usr/include/yuma '''directory contains H files needed to compile
SIL code so it can be loaded into the server at runtime:
** ncx/*.h
** agt/*.h
** platform/*.h
** yangrpc/*.h

[[Yuma Quickstart Guide]]

[[Yuma User Manual]]

[[Yuma netconfd Manual]]

[[Yuma yangcli Manual]]

[[Yuma Developer Manual]]

Each program also has extensive help information available with the'''
--help''' CLI parameter. For example:

* '''yangcli --help'''
* '''netconfd --help'''

== Running the Yuma Programs ==
=== yangcli  ===
If you are just using the Yuma client applications, then there is no
further mandatory setup required.

* If a work directory is used, then the '''$YUMA_HOME '''environment
variable needs to be defined. Refer to the user manual for details.
* If Yuma is installed in a location other than the default location
described above, then the '''$YUMA_INSTALL''' environment variable needs
to be defined. Refer to the user manual for details.
* The following binary applications are available:
** '''/usr/bin/yangcli''': NETCONF-over-SSH client application

=== netconfd and netconf-subsystem ===
The Yuma server does not automatically start running when installed.
This will be supported in a future release.

The following steps must be taken to start the '''netconfd''' server:

* You must modify the '''/etc/ssh/sshd_config''' file, and add the
'netconf' subsystem, as described in the user manual.If the yuma package
was installed in a non-default location, then the path to the
netconf-subsystem will be different than the example below. The
following commands must be present:
     
     '''Port 22'''
     '''Port 830'''
     '''Subsystem netconf /usr/sbin/netconf-subsystem'''

* Start the '''netconfd''' server, as described in the [[Yuma User
Manual]] or the  [[Yuma Quickstart Guide]]. This can be in the
foreground or the background. If it is in the background, then the
''''--log'''' CLI parameter should be provided, as shown below:

 
     mydir> /'''usr/sbin/netconfd --log=$HOME/mylog &'''
     


* Restart the SSH server. This is a platform-specific task. Refer to the
'''sshd''' manual page for your system for more details. This step may
need to be run as root or with the 'sudo' program.


Debian/Ubuntu:
     
     mydir> sudo  /etc/init.d/ssh restart   

Fedora 12 version:
 
     mydir> sudo /etc/rc.d/init.d/sshd restart
