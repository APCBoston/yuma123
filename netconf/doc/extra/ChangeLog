0.9.4

 * Added error check for default and mandatory both set
   in leaf or choice statements
 * Fixed bug in mandatory tests for lists
 * Fixed bug which expanded augment in the wrong place
 * Added config-stmt support within a choice
 * Added error checks for mandatory nodes within an augment
 * Fixed bugs in netconf.yang
 * Fixed bug in expand_augment which failed to set the
   config flag properly, based on the target node
 * Converted all CLI processing to YANG-based data-def files
   - converted yangdump.ncx to yangdump.yang
   - converted yangdiff.ncx to yangdiff.yang
 * Added many extensions to ncx.yang
   * Added ncx:hidden which will cause an object containing
     this extension to be skipped during XSD, HTML, SQLDB,
     and cYANG output
   * Added ncx:cli to prevent CLI parameters from being
     added to the config database
   * Added ncx:root to allow an RPC input container parameter
     to be treated as a <config> root with implicit child
     nodes that are all the top-level nodes within the system
   * Added ncx:password to cause password objects to be
     handled specially (no echo, filter-skip)
   * Added ncx:abstract to treat object definition as an abstract
     definition only -- used internally and to define error-info
     data and OID type identifiers.  Object is not CLI and also
     not added to configuration database
 * Added oldpath and newpath parameters to yangdiff to improve control
   over the files imported/included by the old and new versions of a module
