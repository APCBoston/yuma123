yuma (2.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium
  * Build
    * fix bug added recently that breaks build in libtoaster
      in a plain build (YUMA_HOME not set) and breaks CYGWIN
      build as well

yuma (2.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium
  * netconfd
    * add --runpath to netconfd.yang
    * fix bug reported by Sara Dickinson where leafref was
      not getting validated during commit; turned out leafrefs and
      instance-identifiers were not getting validated for
      target=running or during commit
    * fix bug where <validate> parameters were not handled correctly
      and <ok> was returned without validating the target config.
    * add --factory-startup CLI parameter.
      Currently there is no way to rewrite the invisible
      startup-cfg.xml if --with-startup=false, except
      by modifying the factory settings and saving the config.
      This parameter forces the startup config and the running
      config to contain the factory default settings during
      initialization.
    * fixed bug (reported by Sara Dickinson) where must-stmt tests
      for sibling nodes were getting skipped as soon as 1 must-test
      failed.  This could result in nodes that should be invalid
      left in the running config during load_running_config
      if --startup-error=continue (the default)
    * fix bug in agt_proc.c where CPU cores were not causing
      a new val entry to be created.  Introduced with vi-cov commit
    * add yuma-arp module, implemented by Igor Smolyar
    * fixed bug 3404233
      The client and server both incorrectly accepted
      an XML node for a YANG choice or case node.
      These nodes do not exist in a YANG data tree, just
      in the YANG object tree
    * fix bug in COMMIT phase where SIL callback functions
      for nested nodes were not getting invoked for create
      and merge edit operations.
    * fixed bug introduced in last release where SIL validation
      callbacks are being called multiple times
    * fixed bug where commit callback for editop=OP_EDITOP_DELETE
      the curnode is a detached node -- the parent node is NULL.
    * fixed bug 3395740
    * source tree specified by YUMA_HOME environment variable
      no longer required to be present
    * added libagt.so to shared library install location (d: /usr/lib)
    * using shared libraries in default location for libagt and libncx
      for ubuntu and RPM packaging.  Not static libraries anymore!
    * building and installing libncx.a and libagt.a if STATIC=1
      present in make cmd
    * updated SIL makefile so YUMA_HOME is not used unless
      FORCE_YUMA_HOME=1 is present in the make cmd;
      /usr/lib/yuma is used by default
    * make /arp node present by default, using refactored code from agt_acm.c

  * yangcli
    * add JSON output support for --display-mode=json
      and saving data with @foo.json
    * fix bug where manager session control block not checked for NULL
    * add external parameter support for RPC commands

      yangcli> some-command @filespec.xml

      filespec.xml (in YUMA_DATAPATH) == RPC <input> element
      <input>
        <a>10</a>
        <b>fred</b>
      </input>
    * fixed bug where an edit command (e.g., create) on
      a choice or case node would generate an XML node
      for the choice or case.  Now being removed from
      the XML payload before an <edit-config> is sent

  * yangdump:
    * added support for split SIL files or combined (old way):
      * --format=yc : Yuma SIL C file
      * --format=yh : Yuma SIL H file
      * --format=uc : User SIL C file
      * --format=uc : User SIL H file
      * --format=c  : Combined Yuma/User SIL C file
      * --format=h  : Combined Yuma/User SIL H file
    * added support for code generation for automatic retrieval
      of ancestor-or-self key values in user SIL callbacks
    * Remove #ifdef around #include directives for generated files.
    * fixed bug 3404234
      --format=c output (SIL code) was not handling nested
        config=false containers (lists and leaf-lists still
        not handled!).  Now nested config=false containers
        will automatically be created
    * fixed bug for --format=c where edit callbacks were being
      generated for OBJ_TYP_CHOICE and OBJ_TYP_CASE nodes.
      Since these nodes never exist in a database, these callbacks
      get registered but never invoked
    * fixed bug where SIL code generated for boolean, union, and identityref
      datatypes is incorrect -- the data type will be whatever the union
      was parsed will be treated as a string; causes segfault;
      !!! not fixed in v1
      * union now passed to User SIL function as val_value_t
        instead of string
      * affected edit callback functions and notification send functions
   * added __cplusplus 'extern C' wrappers to H file generation
     for --format=h|uh|yh

  * Build:
   * added --split parameter to make_sil_dir
     * make_sil_dir --split foo  : makes files in foo/src/
        * y_foo.c : Yuma SIL C file
        * y_foo.h : Yuma SIL H file
        * u_foo.c : User SIL C file
        * u_foo.h : User SIL H file
    * building and installing libagt as a dynamic library
    * building Ubuntu package will mostly dynamic libraries
      instead of STATIC=1 and FULL_STATIC=1
    * bumped version to 2.1
    * updated Makefiles to allow debian debuild of 3 packages
      when DEBIAN=1 set:
        no flag: build yuma package
        DEVELOPER=1: build yuma-dev package
        DOC=1: build  yuma-doc package
    * add HTML versions of manuals to install process
    * move PDFs from /usr/share/doc/yuma to /usr/share/doc/yuma/pdf
    * updated user manuals

  * YANG parse:
    * fix error message for leafref-stmt
    * fix bug 3404231
      * incorrect handling of object type when checking
        leaf/leaf-list leafref loops, which could cause
        the wrong struct in a union to be used
    * fixed bug 3404239
      All YANG data-def constructs were being checked for
      config, default, mandatory, min/max-elements
      before refine-stmts were applied.
      Moved all relevant tests from 'resolve' phase to
      'resolve_final' phase.
    * Added modules/test/fail/t13.yang test case for compiler
      to check mandatory+default combo after refine applied.
    * fixed bug: anyxml objects were not getting checked during
      resolve_final phase (mandatory-stmt warnings)
    * suppress error messages when invalid XPath detected during
      validation of a union datatype.  Unions are only required
      to be valid for 1 of N union types, not any particular type.
