This is a module that allows external programs to handle:
 - transactional configuration changes
 - status container read requests

Instead of a custom callback a general interface based on external command invocation is implemented.

Configuration transactions:

 program-cfg --before=<transaction_id_before>.xml --before=<transaction_id_after>.xml

Operational data read transaction:

 program-stat --instance-id=/interface-state/interface[name='ge0']

The registration schema points for the program-stat are specified in a text file. program-stat-cb.txt

The two programs and the text file can be specified as environment variables.
