==What is Yuma123==
The purpose of the Yuma123 project is to provide an opensource YANG API in C and netconf cli (yangcli) and server (netconfd) appications. 
Branching from the last BSD licensed branch of the Yuma project the code has evolved in the following direction:
- a more mainstream build system based on autoconf/automake was added
- a number of critical bugs have been fixed
- new IETF standards support was added (ietf-nacm, ietf-system, etc.)
- support was added for new YANG extensions

==Checkout, Build and Installation steps (ment for Debian should be easy to figure out on other systems)==
sudo apt-get install git autoconf gcc libtool libxml2-dev libssl-dev libssh2-1-dev

git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/yuma123/git yuma123-git
cd yuma123-git
autoreconf -i -f
./configure CFLAGS='-g -O0' CXXFLAGS='-g -O0' --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install
touch /tmp/startup-cfg.xml
/usr/sbin/netconfd --module=helloworld --startup=/tmp/startup-cfg.xml --log-level="debug4" --superuser="$USER"

If there were no missing dependencies the server is now started with the example helloworld module.

Tell sshd to listen on port 830. Add the following 2 lines to /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

Port 830
Subsystem netconf "/usr/sbin/netconf-subsystem --ncxserver-sockname=830@/tmp/ncxserver.sock"

sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart

You can verify everything is OK:

yangcli --user="$USER" --server=localhost
...
xget /helloworld

or

xget /
